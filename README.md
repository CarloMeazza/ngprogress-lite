# ngprogress-light

Nice looking slim progressbars provider for Angular.js applications.

It's minimal bundle of more popular libs (see [references](https://github.com/voronianski/ngprogress-light#References)) to keep it as simple as possible.

## Install

You will need only to include ``ngprogress.css`` to your project, as well as adding ``ngprogress`` service in your controller or directive.

You can download ``ngprogress-light`` manually or install it with bower:

```bash
bower install ngprogress-light
```
