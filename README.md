# ngprogress-lite

Nice looking slim progressbars provider for Angular.js applications.

It's minimal bundle of more popular libs (see [references](https://github.com/voronianski/ngprogress-lite#References)) to keep it as simple as possible.

## Install

You will need only to include ``ngprogress-lite.css`` to your project, as well as adding ``ngProgressLite`` service in your controller, service or directive.

You can download ``ngprogress-lite`` manually or install it with bower:

```bash
bower install ngprogress-lite
```
